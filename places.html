<p>July 7 -- Where I work right now. The weather is a little weird recently; it's very hot with lots of rain and humidity. It's an okay place to live, and I'll miss some of the people. I'm not sorry to leave, though.<br/>
We plan to get out of here by noon on the 14th.</p><br/>

<p>This is the place that Rob's family has decided to have this year's family reunion. They pick a different place every year. Normally his sisters attend and bring their families, and his parents always go because they're the people in charge of setting it up. That's a lot of people, and sometimes extended family shows up too.<br/>
We will be here for a week before moving on to Texas.</p>

<p>This is the last family visit before we go on to Seattle. I want to stop here for at least 3 days, maybe a week</p>
<h1>the rest of the way</h1>
<p>then we drive to Seattle. maybe make some stops on the way. haven't really planned that far ahead, it depends on how much time is left</p>
